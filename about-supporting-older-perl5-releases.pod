=head1 About Supporting Older Releases of perl5 For CPAN Distributions

=head2 TL;DR Summary

Due to several reasons, I am setting a minimal version of perl5 - 5.12.0
or even higher - for some of my L<CPAN,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAN>
distributions. You should either upgrade your perl5, or alternatively pay
me to support older releases of perl5.
